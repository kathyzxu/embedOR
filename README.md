# Testing embedOR algorithm on datasets previously visualized using TSNE and/or UMAP

Notes: 
* The only non-scRNA-seq datasets are Wikipedia (text) and CIFAR (images), both of which were embedded into vector representations using machine learning models.
* ScRNA-seq datasets were titled according to the primary authorâ€™s last name. Preprocessing scripts were written for each dataset individually, as some were more preprocessed than others. Datasets were preprocessed according to the methods detailed in the reference paper when possible. Otherwise, datasets underwent the standard Seurat workflow consisting of filtering, normalization, log-transformation, selecting 2000 most variable genes, and PCA on 50 PCs (unless specified). Finally, datasets were written to .npy.
* Preprocessing scripts for each dataset are available (except for Kanton, which were entirely preprocessed prior). Consult datasets_summary.csv for more information about each dataset.
* All plots were generated with n_points = 5000, set.seed = 42.
* Permutation tests measure low-energy edge expansion (Tables 3, 6) and high-energy edge contraction (Tables 7,8). All  tests were run with 10,000 permutations and 5000 subsampled points for datasets with more than 5000 samples.
